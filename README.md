Understanding how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently to convert casual riders into annual riders

### Project Overview

Cyclistic is a bike_share company based in Chicago that wants to maximize the number of annual memberships. This data analysis project aims to provide insight into how annual members and casual riders differ. This is important to understand why casual riders would buy a membership and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.


### Data Sources

Bike Data: The primary datasets used for this analysis are the "Index of Bucket" files which can be found HERE. These datasets are seperated by months. They include the following columns: ride_id, rideabe_type, started_at, ended_at, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id, and member_casual. I chose datasets for 12 months starting in March 2023 to February 2024.
